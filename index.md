My name is Pedro Pablo Vega Fernandez. I am currently an international student in fourth year of engineering in France's graduate school of cognitics (applied cognitive science and technology) and I am currently searching for an internship on software development, AI and neuroscience.
I use this repository as a portfolio/blog where I keep track of all my projects and enterprises, personal or professional.
## In here you will find
- ### A quick view into my education background
